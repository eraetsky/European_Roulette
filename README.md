# European_Roulette
European Roulette console game on C++

You have an initial balance of $1000. As in real European Roulette, you can chose a colour - red or black, even or odd number, or pick a number. If you want to bet on 0, you must chose a number instead of chosing green colour. There is now difference in entering options in upper or lower case, with spaces or without, for example, "RED", "rEd ", "   REd" means the same as "red". Bet on colour or divisibility will increase or decrease your balance by 10%, while betting on a particular number will possibly increase it by 110%! The ratio for each category can be easily changed. 
The Game continues until your balance is greater than 0. After each bet it is possible go quit the game simply by pressing 'q' button on keyboard.

Hints are avaliable in console througout all gameplay process.
